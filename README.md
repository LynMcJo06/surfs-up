# surfs-up
# Module 9 - Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval
## Background
While vacationing in Hawaii, I fell in love with surfing and now want to permanently live in Hawaii.  I want to open a surf and shake shop but need an investor.  My investor's name is W. Avy and he is concerned about weather impacting the business; therefore, he has asked me to provide information on past weather patterns.  
## Lesson 1
For my first lesson, I download the weather data and prepare my tools.  For this analysis, I will be using Jupyter Notebook, SQLite, and SQLAlchemy.  All the necessary installations have been performed.  I am ready to start my analysis.  
## Lesson 2
In this lesson, I retrieved the precipitation data and saved it to a Pandas dataframe.  I sorted the data based on date and created a plot.  Some months definitely receive more precipitation than other months.  I also performed a statistical analysis on the data, which I will present to W. Avy.
